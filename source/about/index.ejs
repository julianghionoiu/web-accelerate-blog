			Hi,
			<br/>
			Iâ€™m Julian. At heart I am a lead-developer-turned-entrepreneur.
		</p>

		<p>I learn by doing, so the way I explore a new language or technique is to approach it hands-on.<p>

		<p>
			A while back I was practicing a technique called "TDD As If You Meant It".
			I was getting better at it but a question started popping up in my head. It was more like a concern.
			<b>When should you introduce a new technique to your production work?</b><br/>
			If you do it too early it might affect your productivity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Up to that point I was practicing using simple code katas so moving from the practice katas to a live system felt like a big leap.<br/>
			I needed something in-between, something like a simulation of a real-world scenario.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is how I came with the idea of simulating multiple incremental requirements to create a more complex, real-world challenge.
			The principle was that <b>I would use this challenge until I have mastered the new technique</b> and it would not affect my productivity.
			Only then I would start applying the technique in my day to day business work.<br/>
			This worked very well for me as it provided objective metrics on how well I was doing.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 2016 I have decided to share this approach with the community and this lead to the creation of <a href="befaster.io">BeFaster.io</a>, a data-driven workshop were people put their development technique to the test.
		</p>

		<p>
			Given the objective feedback that people were getting from the coding challenge, a friend suggested that these insights would be really useful during the recruitment process.<br/>
			Having interviewed developers myself, I would have loved to have such detailed insights into someone coding style and delivery speed.
			This lead to the creation of the Accelerate.io platform in 2017.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like to think that I am making the recruitment experience better by turning this into a <b>learning experience for the candidate</b>.<br/>
			This is my way of giving back to the community.
		</p>
